# ColdFusion / Lucee lnav log format

[lnav](https://lnav.org/) is a wonderful log file viewer in terminal for Mac and Linux. This repo provides a CFML log format definition file for lnav so that you can use lnav properly to view CF & Lucee log files.

To use, download the `cflog.json` definition file from the `lnav-format` folder then install it with lnav with the following command:
> `lnav -i cflog.json`
